# Motivations

Because I needed a way to remember to claim Unreal Engine's free of the month assets, I added a discord webhook integrations to get a notification and a quick overview of the assets.

# How to use

1. Create a discord webhook
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run in background `python src/main.py &`
   4.a. Or run in foreground `python src/main.py`
   4.b. You can bring to foreground with `fg` and kill with `kill %n` where `n` is the job number
5. ???
6. Profit
